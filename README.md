# Wikipedia-Data-Scraping-Project

This project aimed to use the Python libraries 'Beautiful Soup' and 'Requests' to data scrape the first table off of the "Largest Companies in the United States by Revenue" page of the Wikipedia website. After that, I used the Python library 'Pandas' to create a data frame with the data that I scraped.
